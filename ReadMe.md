Is Palindrome Code Challenge
============================

Write a function to determine if the value provided is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards).

*   The function should not be case sensitive (abcCBA is a palindrome)
*   The function should take special characters into account (a,b,c,CBA is not a palindrome)
*   The function should ignore spaces (a b c CBA is a palindrome)
